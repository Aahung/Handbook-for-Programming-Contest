Intro
=======================================

The handbook is for quick look on general programming contest like ACM.

The handbook is built with Sphinx. Lanuage demostrated here is C/C++.

==========================
Motivation
==========================

I have been using the code template made by Shanghai JiaoTong
University for a long time. And I found some problems.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""
The codes are "bad codes"
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

When I say the code is bad doesn't mean the code doesn't work or performance is poor.
As a code template, I think the goal is to achive

- it works
- avoid mistyping (due to the tense in the contest environment)

While the second is a huge problem. I know sometimes in order to type fast,
the variables' name may need to be as short as possible.
But readability is really an issue considering the insanely short variables
in the template made by Shanghai JiaoTong University.

A nice code style gives you a nice mood during the contest. So in this handbook,
the variables' naming will be *intention-revealing*, readability is first concern,
I need you to understand the code first, then you will not make typing mistake,
finally you will type fast.

This handbook is currently at very beginning, where content is far away from **enough**.
If you are interested in making it better, please **DO**.
